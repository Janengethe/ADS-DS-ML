#### Assignment Lab or Practical Work
Introduction to Python using Replit
##### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to Python programming and the Replit environment. You will learn basic Python concepts and use Replit to write, run, and share your Python scripts.

##### Tasks:
1. Create a new Python Repl:
Follow the instructions in the "Getting Started with Replit Python" tutorial to create a new Python Repl.
Name your Repl "PythonIntroAssignment".
2. Familiarize yourself with Python syntax:
In your Python Repl, experiment with basic Python concepts, such as printing messages to the console, assigning values to variables, and performing arithmetic operations.
* Example: To print "Hello, World!" to the console, you can use the following command:
* answer
print("Hello, World!")
​
Hello, World!
* Example: To add two numbers, you can use the following commands:

num1 = 5
num2 = 3
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
​
The sum of 5 and 3 is 8
3. Write a Python script that prompts the user for their name and greets them:
*In your Python Repl, write a Python script that asks the user for their name using the input() function. *Example:

name = input("Please enter your name: ")
Please enter your name: g
Print a personalized greeting to the console using the entered name. Example:

print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python programming.")
​
Hello, g! Welcome to Python programming.
4. Write a Python script that prompts the user for two numbers and prints their sum:
In your Python Repl, write a Python script that asks the user for two numbers using the input() function.
Convert the entered values from strings to integers using the int() function.
* Example:
num1 = int(input("Please enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Please enter the second number: "))
​
Please enter the first number: 33
Please enter the second number: 55
Calculate the sum of the two numbers and print the result to the console.
* Example:
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
​
The sum of 33 and 55 is 88
5. Share your Python Repl:
Once you have completed the tasks above, share your Repl by following the instructions in the "Getting Started with Replit Python" tutorial.
Submit the link to your shared Repl as your assignment.
* Note: If you encounter any difficulties or have questions about Python syntax, you can refer to the Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/) or ask for help from your instructor or peers.

### Wednesday
#### Tasks:
1. Create a new Python Repl:
Follow the instructions in the "Getting Started with Replit Python" tutorial to create a new Python Repl.
Name your Repl "Day2PythonBasicsAssignment".
2. Demonstrate the use of variables and data types:
In your Python Repl, create variables of different data types (integers, floats, strings, and booleans) and assign them appropriate values.
Use the print() function to display the variables and their types in the console.
3. Perform arithmetic operations:
In your Python Repl, write a Python script that demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation) with integer and float variables.
Print the results of the operations in the console.
4. Demonstrate the use of comparison and logical operators:
In your Python Repl, write a Python script that demonstrates the use of comparison operators (equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to) and logical operators (and, or, not) with integer and boolean variables.
Print the results of the operations in the console.
5. Create a Python script that takes user input and performs basic calculations:
In your Python Repl, write a Python script that prompts the user for two numbers using the input() function.
Convert the entered values from strings to integers or floats as needed.
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on the entered numbers.
6. Share your Python Repl:
Once you have completed the tasks above, share your Repl by following the instructions in the "Getting Started with Replit Python" tutorial. Submit the link to your shared Repl as your assignment.

* Note: If you encounter any difficulties or have questions about Python syntax, you can refer to the Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/) or ask for help from your instructor or peers.
