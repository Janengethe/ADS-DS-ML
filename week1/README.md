Data Structures Assignment using Replit
* Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to help you practice data structures in Python. You will use Replit to write, run, and share Python scripts that demonstrate your understanding of lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, along with their methods and comprehension techniques.

###### Tasks:
1. Create a new Python Repl:
Follow the instructions in the "Getting Started with Replit Python" tutorial to create a new Python Repl.
Name your Repl "Day5DataStructuresAssignment"
2. Write a Python script that demonstrates the use of lists:
In your Python Repl, create a list of integers and perform the following operations:
Add an element to the end of the list using the append() method.
Remove an element from the list using the remove() method.
Sort the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
Use list comprehension to create a new list containing the squares of the original list's elements.
Print the original and the new lists to the console.
3. Write a Python script that demonstrates the use of tuples:
In your Python Repl, create a tuple of strings and perform the following operations:
Access elements of the tuple using indexing.
Count the occurrences of a specific element in the tuple using the count() method.
Print the tuple and the count of the specific element to the console.
4. Write a Python script that demonstrates the use of dictionaries:
In your Python Repl, create a dictionary with keys as names (strings) and values as ages (integers).
Perform the following operations:
Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary.
Update the value of an existing key in the dictionary.
Remove a key-value pair from the dictionary using the pop() method.
Print the dictionary to the console.
5. Write a Python script that demonstrates the use of sets:
In your Python Repl, create two sets of integers.
Perform the following operations:
Calculate the union of the two sets using the union() method.
Calculate the intersection of the two sets using the intersection() method.
Calculate the difference between the two sets using the difference() method.
Print the original sets and the results of the operations to the console.
6. Share your Python Repl:
Once you have completed the tasks above, share your Repl by following the instructions in the "Getting Started with Replit Python" tutorial. Submit the link to your shared Repl as your assignment.

* Note: If you encounter any difficulties or have questions about Python data structures, you can refer to the Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) or ask for help from your instructor or peers.
